Big 3 Tracker
This browser app allows you to track people's "Big Three" astrological signs: sun, moon, and rising signs. With this app, you can add new people's information using a form and visually identify their sun sign element with different colors.


Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The friend menu will display images of existing friends. Click on an image to view the details of that friend.
To add a new friend, fill out the form in the "New Friend" section with their name, image URL, sun sign, moon sign, and rising sign. Click the "Add" button to submit the form.
Upon submission, a popup message will appear, confirming that the new friend has been added.
The friend menu will update to include the newly added friend, and the friend detail section will display their information.
Examples
The app includes some example friend data in the friends.json file. You can explore and modify this data to test the functionality of the app.

Please note that this app currently assumes the availability of a local server running on http://localhost:3000/friends to retrieve the friend data using a fetch request. Make sure to set up a suitable server or modify the JavaScript code to fetch the data from a different source.
